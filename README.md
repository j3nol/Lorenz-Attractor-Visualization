# Lorenz-Attractor-Visualization

This Processing sketch visualizes the Lorenz attractor, a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations. The visualization is created using the Processing programming environment.

## How to Run

To run the visualization, you need to have Processing installed on your system. You can download Processing from [the official website](https://processing.org/download/).

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Main.pde` file in Processing.
3. Click the "Run" button or press `Ctrl + R` to execute the sketch.
4. Interact with the visualization using the mouse to rotate the camera view.

## About the Lorenz Attractor

The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, a set of differential equations originally studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for its chaotic behavior, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and butterfly-shaped trajectory.
